## IDE

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) to get the best experience (You might want to disable Vetur if you have it).

## Auth0 setup
First of all, you need to create Auth0 acount and SDK setup. 
https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs

You need to create `.env` file with this content from Auth0 project (security credentials should never be shared):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Rename .env.example as .env and set environment values

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment).
